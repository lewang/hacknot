# hacknot.org

I remembered the good ole' times when I had first found out about
[Hacknot.info](http://www.hacknot.info) which is gone.

Luckily I had found the original collection of essays e.g. at
[this blog post](https://beinghappyprogramming.wordpress.com/2012/08/13/do-you-like-hacknot/)
which I had converted to `.org` and via `pandoc` to several other formats.
